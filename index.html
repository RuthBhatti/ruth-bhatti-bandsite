                    The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California. The band consists of a
                    dynamic lineup featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist, and a
                    drummer.
                    The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention from their
                    future
                    manager. Having extensive experience working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was
                    confident
                    the band could succeed even further with more support, pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a
                    well-known
                    record label.

                <p class="band-info__description">
                    From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the
                    Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic attitude,
                    solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest up-and-coming acts of this century. Fans
                    affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and authentic
                    performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording their second studio album, looking to
                    be
                    released in early 2024.
